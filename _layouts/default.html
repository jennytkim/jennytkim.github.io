				<h2>Great Canadian Sales Competition</h2>
			</header>
			<p> <a href="https://greatcanadiansalescompetition.com">GCSC</a>, I had the opportunity to represent Acklands-Grainger at the finals where I competed with 21 other finalists (out of 2,107 submissions).
				The weeks leading up to the finals, I was mentored by a sales director at Acklands-Grainger who taught me about sales and how to hold a sales meeting.
				For the finals, I had to conduct a live sales roleplay in front of panel of 6 judges.
				I also had the privilege of working with CBC's Dianne Buckner (former host of Dragon's Den) to film a segment about the competition and the perception of sales by students today.</p>

			<p>The segment was aired on CBC, check it out here:</p>

				<h2>Next Top Ad Exec</h2>
			</header>
			<p>For the <a href="https://topadexec.com">Next Top Ad Exec</a>, I created a experiential marketing campaign for the then-newly launched GM's Maven app.
			Maven is a car sharing and rental app that's available in select U.S. and Canadian cities. For the campaign, I conducted market research, segmentation, created a ~$200k budget, calculated ROI & CPA, and developed mockups for the digital portion of the campaign.</p>

				<h2>Wayke</h2>

			<p>During Queen's Hackathon, my team and I created a mobile app that is integrated with the MUSE headband, pebble watch, and Grove so that it monitors your brainwaves.
				Wayke will notify you when to take a break or even help you stay alert in a pinch. We offer an unparalleled solution to lost productivity due to drowsiness.For this project, I worked on all of the designs and UI/UX.</p>

			 <p>Concierge was created during the Queen's Innovation Connector Summer Initiative incubator.
				 The startup focused on enabling small stores to advertise through their Wi-Fi network while providing free and secure Wi-Fi to customers.
				 I created all designs including the logo, app mockups, and marketing material. Additionally, I helped with the business and marketing plan.
